For fun my coworkers__ and I are watching the SICP videos and doing the releated `6.001 MIT opencourseware`__.

__ http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/

These are my solutions to the problems/tests from the book and course.


Install Tools
=============
Ubuntu assumed. ::

  apt-get install mit-scheme rlwrap
  rlwrap scheme -large

rlwrap makes the repl not suck(paren matching, readline like history).
